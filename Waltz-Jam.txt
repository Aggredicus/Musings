By the calm
of the night
and the balm
of moonlight
we can feel
what is right
become real
in plain sight:
a holy plan,
nature's might,
as each man
and woman
seeks their place
in a clan
whose hands reach
the world's span
and can teach
what it means
to use speech
for the cause
they beseech:
open maws,
make your speech,
fix your flaws,
pastor preach,
grasp at straws,
know your self,
dust the shelf,
write your laws,
play the elf,
master health,
break the laws,
grieve your loss,
practice stealth,
crow your caws,
earn some wealth,
and the last,
but not least,
some applause
and some hype,
from the edge
of your seats,
for open mic
poem night!
