Yet remains, the lingering brightness of intellect:
Two parties held Three God's, as One.
One, of Hermes and Abraham.
The Other, of Lucifer and Hitler.
And Three, the Holy Superior Above.
One held to healing,
And the Other turned to harm,
While Both knew the God above.
Even though they could stop,
Man turned to His Tritium
And forged an idol of relic
For the Holy Superior Above,
Only to miss its Mark
And become misinterpreted
For using God's Tools for War.
Let them Be for Creation and Beauty
