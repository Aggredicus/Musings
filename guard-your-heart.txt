Listen closely and hear.
To those that say, 
"Guard your heart,"
I say, 
"Nay! 
Instead, circumcise your heart!
Lay it raw to the barest skin,
such that it has becomes sensitive
to the suffering of all: self and other.
Let its nakedness serve as a reminder
to all Life's plea for Love and Union.
Feel the other such that you may
truly feel your Selfsame touch."
