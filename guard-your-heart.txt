Listen closely and hear.
To those that say, 
"Guard your heart,"
I say, 
"Nay! 
Instead, circumcise your heart!
Lay it raw to the barest skin,
such that it has becomes sensitive
to the suffering of all: self and other.
Let its nakedness serve as a reminder
to all Life's plea for Love and Union.
Feel the other such that you may
truly feel your Selfsame touch."

// The skeleton of this poem occurred to me as a shower thought.
// I had just been mowing the grass while listening to the Bible (KJV audiobook app) for the first time. I listened to James 1-5, Acts 1-10, and then Matthew 2627.
// I had never been particularly fond of the Bible as a child, due to the nature of Christians I saw worshipping in my hometown of Hudsonville. Now, I see that the practice of my peers was not truly inspired. Instead, I offer this message to people of the faith which have never pondered the purpose of circumcision. To circumcise the penis is pointless to a child whose heart is never circumcised in kind. This concept was first crystallized while reading the so-called Gospel of Thomas. While I understand that Gnosticism is heretical, I still consider this nugget of truth to be intriguing. This is but a small glimmer of that much larger truth, but I consider it a worthwhile idea to share.
// I thank you for reading, and I hope that you feel that thanking with genuine warmth.
// (DL 6/5/18)
