Like the sun over ocean
light dances to eyes
to remind us of the stars
all their glamoured ties.

So you pry your ribs open
and let in the rays,
'cause you know that love's not ours
and numbered in days,

but you just can't stop hopin'
you won't be alone
so you pay up in love scars
to heal though you groan.

Now don't you keep on gripin'
the journey's too rough:
there's no fire above Mars
but wholeness by cuff.
