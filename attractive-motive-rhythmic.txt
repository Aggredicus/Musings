Rarely ever do souls connect
without attraction at the helm
to steer the course and feed the horse
which guides a body to motion.
Through dance, or love's trance, no matter.
In combat, or defense of stance-
the same contact- just different sort.
Mind flexing anticipation,
we urge the other into us
that we may strike when desired.
Together, each locks in other
that the scenery disappears
and we truly feel the rhythm
of another stirring heartbeat.
