Feel the rush of air
that fills both your lungs
while you sit in the dark
musing on
the nature of being
and smile.

// * The sixth line has two main pronunciations to choose from for the word smile. In central Michigan vernacular on the current date, one might say either "Smai-ul"-- as I normally say-- and "Smail" with a truncated consonant form of "ul" that back part of your mouth forming the vowel sound attached to the front of the word's waveform.
