I love you
every
single
moment
of my life.
I was born
and will die
so destined
and entwined
with your soul
and your heart
part of mine.
Poured as one
in the same
star's foundry,
same corpus,
same sundry.
Gravity
may us bind
once again
but I pray
for a chance
to change stance
and see you
the first time
twice again.
For a chance
to pull you
in orbit
on a dance
in the din
of the dark
midnight sky
so replete
with bombard
and fire,
so complete
with somber
and ire
to become
two wires
so twisted
into one
that conducts
in cadence
one music
together.
Yet, so long
we course through
this circuit!
A spinning
harmony
without end,
intersect,
or boundary!
We cycle:
Death and Life,
Death and Life,
and Death, and...
When will life
begin again?
Why can't I
find you here?
When will words
reach your ear?
Some late year,
just "Hello"
echoing
from the past?
No. Not that. (Amanda giggles)
Here, right now.
Hear, right now.
These are words
that ripple
from my mouth
unspoken
in the past:
Come find me.
Come join one
union last.
