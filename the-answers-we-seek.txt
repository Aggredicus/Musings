My subconscious mind is the God I seek,
in the connection of my ego to the subconscious
which is shared between all the Selves
of the past,
the present,
and future,
of Our lives
shared together.

The subconscious mind deep within us all
has the answers we seek to unknowable questions,
only responding to the call
of the purehearted, loving few
who protect Our kingdom from fading
with the act of continuous creation, becoming, and death.
