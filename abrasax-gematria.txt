ABRASAX (ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ)

Α = 1
Β = 2
Ρ = 100
Α = 1
Σ = 200
Α = 1
Ξ = 60

(1 + 2 + 100 + 1 + 200 +1 +60) = 365

Likewise, St. Jerome makes a claim that Mithras (ΜΕΙΘΡΑΣ) has a gematria value of 365 as well, corresponding to the number of days in a well formed year.

Μ = 40
Ε = 5
Ι = 10
Θ = 9
Ρ = 100
Α = 1
Σ = 200

(40 + 5 + 10 + 9 + 100 + 1 + 200)

And it appears that it is the case with Greek letters, still.

Α = 1
Β = 2
Ξ = 60
Δ = 4
Ε = 5
Φ = 500
Γ = 3
Η = 8
Ι = 10
Σ = 200
Κ = 20
Λ = 30
Μ = 40
Ν = 50
Ο = 70
Π = 80
Θ = 9
Ρ = 100
Σ = 200
Τ = 300
Υ = 400
Ϝ = 6
Ω = 800
Χ = 600
Ψ = 700
Ζ = 7

Ϙ = 90
ϡ = 900
