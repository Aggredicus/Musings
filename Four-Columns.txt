In throes we flail
with the rhythms
of conjoining
and ravelling
through low, through high
by glow of thigh
as we two ride
like eagles o'er tide
that we steal quick
each other beat
and breath, lips slick,
mad with the heat
necks tense repleat
with musk so sweet
clung tight and pulled
in moonlight dulled
by the lacey veil
draped four columns.
