People see the white collar
on the black tunic and know
a priest walks in their presence.
What feature ought I now bear
to mark myself as mystic
in my own unique fashion?
A pinecone around the neck
has brought several souls to me,
but this is not explicit.
The rootstained robes have a draw
that a Buddhist can't deny,
but else may still fit the eye.
Perhaps the right cape or scarf
would do me the magic trick
to show my virtue so quick.
