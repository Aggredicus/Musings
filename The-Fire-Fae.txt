Take me on down dancing
in Forest of Fae
to beckon the spirits
of dreaming and play.
Two souls drawn in fancy
two lovers we may
twirl endless in worship
onto the next day.

Now look back on midnight
on footwork aflame
and haze of the spirits
all sadness could tame.
We burn up the prayer
to All in his name
with heat in the moonlight
love only to blame.
